# SYSC4806-Perk_Manager-Group20
![Build Status](https://github.com/H-Jallad/SYSC4806-Perk_Manager-Group20/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

#### Project Description:

The User can create a Profile with all the memberships and cards she has: Air Miles, CAA, credit card etc. A "Perk" is some kind of discount for a given membership and a given product: 10% off movies with a Visa card, free domestic flight with 10,000 Air Miles, etc. Perks may also have limitations in geographic area and in time. These perks can be posted anytime by any user (the user may first need to enter the product or membership for which the perk applies). Users can upvote or downvote these perks depending on whether they find them useful or incorrect. Search results for perks can be listed in decreasing amount of votes, or by expiry date. Logged-in users can search for products for which there are perks available matching their profile. A user without a profile (or not logged-in) can still search for perks, but won't get the benefit of finding matches for their memberships.

## Milestone 1: Early Prototype:

This program consists of a page to add a user, a page to add memberships, and a page to add perks to memberships. When the programis run, the landing consists of a button that adds a general user to the system and displays the user id. They can then press a link on that page to go back to add another user, or to go to the memberships page. If they select the link to go to the memberships page, the user will then be able to choose from a predetermined list of memberships via a dropdown list. The memberships they select represent memberships they own. They can then press a button to save their membership and dislay it. From here, they could click a link to add more memberships, click the link to view all their memberships, or click the link to allow them to add perks to memberships. If they click that link, they will be presented with two textboxes to add the perk name and description respectively, They will also see a dropdown list where they can seect the membership that the perk corresponds to. From here, the user can save their inbuts via a save button, and then view the perk. From here, the user can click a link which would allow them to view all the perks they have and the memberships they correspond to.

## Plan For Next Sprint:

The team will worktowards adding a greater level of functionality to the system to make it more useful. The team will work towards having login functionality enabled by the next sprint, and to allow multiple users to use the system with no issues. Furthermore, an enhanced user interface to show the results in a cleaner fashion shall be considered for the next sprint.
